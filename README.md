# Healthcare-ChatBot
Building an interactive Healthcare ChatBot for medical prognosis
The repository contains the models, images and scripts to run an interactive interface that allows you to chat with the IA. This ChatBot can have basic conversations: "Hi how are you", "What's your name?", ... and should be able to diagnose you if synthoms are provided.

Future improvements:

  路 Add the "talking ChatBot" feature from speech.py
  
  路 Make the face show different emotions depending of the message recieved
  
  路 Add the diagnose feature from chat_pred.py
  
  路 Improve the answering using Deep Learning models
